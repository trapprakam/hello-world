My introduction into GitHub

My name is Rakim Trapp-Jackson. Since taking Algorithm and Design I w/ C/C++ and Algorithm and Design II w/ C/C++ my senior year of my undergraduate studies, I instantly fell in love with programming. I'm talking a love at first site type of love. Since then I been on the quest to learn everything I can about the subject and along my journal I discovered GitHub and here I am. So far, I've been programming in Python, Java, and C++. Planning on learning other languages, such as JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Prolog, etc. I'm interested in Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, and Animation and CGI motion. Look forward to create projects to post on GitHub and view other people work, hopefully collaborate with other programmers on projects, and meet some interested people who share the same passion in programming.
